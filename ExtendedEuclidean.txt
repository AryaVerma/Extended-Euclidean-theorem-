Extended euclidean :


We need to find integral x and y such that

ax + by =gcd(a,b);

Solution:   So what we do in euclid theorem is...
            we recursivly calculate the gcd as following.
 	    
            int gcd(int a,int b)
            {
                if(a==0)
                   return b;
                return gcd(b%a,a);
            }
            Now from above for a and b in recursive call ( gcd(a,b) , gcd(b%a,a) .....so on till first term gets to be zero)
            ,we would always have hcf or gcd which will be equal to gcd(a,b);
            
            For the base case when first term gets zero,
            gcd(0,bfinal) , solution x and y would look like this x*0 + y*bfinal=gcd(a,b)

            Actually in the last line bfinal will be gcd(a,b)(why? see function where a is 0 we return b) , therefore x is 0
            and y is 1 for base case.
            L

            Let's define the function...
            int gcdExtended(int a, int b, int& x,int& y)
            {
                 if(a==0)        //Base case as given explanation above
                 {
                      x=0;
                      y=1;
                      return b;
                 }
                 int x1,y1;
                 int gcd=gcdExtended(b%a , a,  x1, y1);
                 x=y1-(b/a)x1;
                 y=x1;           // Proof or explanation given below
                 return gcd;
            }
           
            So let's take a look at general case and how it really works
            
            ax  + by = gcd(a,b)
            
            (b%a)x1 + ay1= gcd(a,b)

            equating we get
            ax  +by  = (b%a)x1 + ay1                          ----A
            
            Now b=a*(b/a)+b%a ;     (can we write this?)
            put this in equation A
            ax  +(a*(b/a) + b%a)y = (b%a)x1 + ay1           -------B

            So we already know a,b,x1 and y1 we need to find x and y (integral values)

            Now if put      (y=x1)    we get equation B as following
            ax + a*(b/a)y = ay1
         ->  x +   (b/a)y =y1
         ->  x = y1  -  (b/a)x1    


            So we obtain x=y1  -  (b/a)x1 and y=x1
